# Chrome Extension for People in Parks non-profit
## Social ImpHacked

This is a chrome extension that was created for the non-profile **People in Parks**
(http://www.peopleinparks.org/index.html).  When opening a new tab, we show
a picture from a national park while displaying the time, a fact about the
park, and more information

## Getting Started
1. Run `npm install`
2. Relevant code is in `social-imphacked/app/src`
3. Develop:
    * Locally develop by running `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000`
    * To check on chrome extensions, run `npm run dev`, go to `chrome://extensions`, load local chrome file (`social-imphacked/app`).  To constantly see changes here as an extension, you must run `npm run dev` each time before clicking `refresh` for the chrome extension
