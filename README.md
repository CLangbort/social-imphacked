# Chrome Extension for People in Parks non-profit
## Social ImpHacked

This is a chrome extension that was created for the non-profile **People in Parks**
(http://www.peopleinparks.org/index.html). This chrome extension replaces a new
tab with pictures of national parks while showing the time, various facts, and
much more.

#### Description
Celebrate the great outdoors and one of the things that makes America so beautiful
with a new tab screen of a National Park image brought to you each day. Be inspired
by the sweeping vistas and striking scenes of America's National Parks. Learn more
about the park of the day with rotating facts that appear at the bottom of your
screen, and find photographers who capture the views right in the app. Developed
for People In Parks, a non-profit dedicated to enhancing the visitor experience
in western National Parks.
